ALPHABET INC. (GOOG/GOOGL) - COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS

1. INTRODUCTION
Alphabet Inc. operates as a conglomerate with various subsidiaries. While "Google Services" (Search, Ads, Android, YouTube) generates the bulk of revenue, "Google Cloud" and "Other Bets" (Waymo, Verily, etc.) face distinct competitive environments.

2. SEGMENT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT

A. Search & AI (The Core)
While Google holds a massive monopoly on search (~91%), the landscape is shifting from traditional keyword search to Generative AI.
- The Main Threat: Microsoft (MSFT) has integrated OpenAI's GPT-4 into Bing, attempting to erode Google's dominance.
- Emerging Threat: Perplexity AI and ChatGPT (OpenAI) are becoming direct destinations for information retrieval, bypassing traditional search engines entirely.

B. Cloud Computing (GCP)
Google Cloud Platform is firmly in 3rd place behind AWS and Azure.
- Strategy: Google differentiates via data analytics, BigQuery, and AI/ML capabilities.
- Competition: The "Big Three" (Amazon, Microsoft, Google) account for roughly 66% of the global market.

C. Digital Advertising
This is a three-horse race often called "The Triopoly": Google, Meta, and Amazon.
- Trend: Amazon is eating into market share because its ads appear at the "point of purchase," offering better conversion data than top-of-funnel search ads.
- Regulatory Risk: Google faces antitrust lawsuits regarding its ad-tech stack, which could force divestitures, changing the competitor list significantly.

3. "OTHER BETS" ANALYSIS

A. Waymo (Autonomous Driving)
- Waymo is currently leading in actual driverless commercial operations (L4 autonomy).
- Tesla is the main ideological competitor, betting on a vision-only approach (FSD) deployed to millions of consumer cars, whereas Waymo relies on LiDAR/Mapping in geofenced areas.
